This repo contains the materials for the Workshop: Swift for beginners.

In CityQuiz you can find the app that we are going to develop during the workshop.
Inside there are folders with all the steps of the workshop, and another one with the final version of the app.

This app consists in 4 images and in every round you will be asked to match a city to the images. You have to select one of the images and see if you selected the correct one. Every time you select an image, you'll see an alert telling you if you hit was correct or not. For each round you receive a score. You can reset your game and start all over again.
